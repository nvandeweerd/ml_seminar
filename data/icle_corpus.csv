"BRFF1062.txt"," <ICLE-BR-FF-0062.1>  Some people defend that there is no longer place for dreaming and imagination in our modern world dominated by science, technology and industrialization. The first step in order to agree or disagree with this affirmative is to ask who are these people that defend this point of view.   The importance of such a question relies on the fact that it seems highly improbable to researchers of any field to propose this idea. If a simplified division of the research fields on Human sciences and Natural sciences is considered, it can be examined that neither of the sides would have reasons to affirm the end of dreaming and imagination in the modern world.  On the one hand, to what regards the humanistic approach to society, the importance of the individuals and their idiossincracies and maleability must be highlighted. In this sense, researchers who praise the individuals will probably also praise human characteristics and encourage the use and widespread of them.  On the other hand, to what concerns the natural sciences, the idea that the researchers from these fields would defend the end of dreaming and imagination and praise science, technology and industrialization instead, is merely common sense. In the burgois society, industrialization and technology motivates dreaming at the same time as the peoples dreams are the basis for the development of these areas. In addition, imagination is a crucial element to science, as Einstein once said that the success of his discoveries were also due to the use of imagination. In science, imagination is the key element that allows the researcher to try one stepahead the theories which are already proved, and, sometimes, change a paradigme.  The second aspect to be analized, in order to discuss the truth of the topic statement of this paper, is the concept of the terms being used. In this sense, several questions should be asked before agreeing or not with the main idea. In addition to the question about who some people are, there must be more questions about the other concepts, so as clarify the true meaning of the statement. For example, what is the meaning of modern world here? What concept of dreaming and imagination is being used as a base? Why are science, technology and industrialization being united in one single group? Aren't there enough differences among them so as to separate one from the others?  Although I completely disagree with the initial statement, I think it is only possible to really understand the complexity of the topic if some of the questions above were answered and explained. Until then, one can only discuss it based on vague arguments and opinions.

"BRFF1063.txt"," <ICLE-BR-FF-0063.1>  This sentence may seem a cliche at first, but it is an unbearable reality that the world is supposed to swallow. The human values such as love, respect and honesty are being darkened or replaced by the desire of pursuit at any price, and the worst part is that this tendency is spreading faster than the mechanisms created to stop it.   All the spheres of our society are, unfortunately, ruled by the greed. The money itself is not the evil. People have a job and work every day to earn money and have a decent life. The problem starts when one does not see any limits in order to achieve the final goal, which is the money. To some people, the target is only to earn enough for living and to others, the more the better, no matter the means used to reach this continuum. We have reached a point that street sweepers, for example, will only keep a certain place cleaner than usual if someone who is interested in it gives him an extra sum to perform such task carefully; police officers will allow some people to be involved with gun smuggling if they give them a tip; a judge will free someone accused of murder if the murderer and his gang give him a fincial support to do so; the politicians from the Lower and Upper Houses will approve measures that represent the interests of a few men if their monthly bribe (Mensalo) is payed. What is the motivation for this lack of ethic?  The corruption net that starts with a simple street sweeper, passing through the police officer, the judge and reaching the most powerful leaders of a country is a practice that arised to institutionalize the ambition in relation to money. Some people forgot the meaning, others simply never knew it. They decided not to measure the consequences of their acts. If the street sweeper spent more time cleaning one place, it means that others were left dirty. Allowing smuggling, police officers are taking the money that belong to the government.  a sum that could help building schools or even give them a raise. If the politicians, who already receive a salary to perform their duties, receive bribes from high authorities of the government, thousands of citizens will not receive the support that supposedly must come from the government. Nowadays, people are misunderstanding the role of money in the human life. It is fantastic to have a good house, a beautiful car and other good things that money can buy. But honesty, humanity and love can never be bought. Again, it is not a cliche, it is an appeal to the ones who seem to be busy enough trying to get money that can not see the real worthwhile purposes of life.

"BRFF1065.txt"," <ICLE-BR-FF-0065.1>  The main aim of this argumentative essay is to discuss and debate some remarkable ideas among human beings. <*  Taking George Orwell's novel Animal Farm as a model, it is truly relevant to point out the concept of power and oppression in our nowadays lives. Even though Animal Farm was based on the Russian Revolution of 1917 in a total different context, some ideas still make sense today. It is clear that the novel was written to raise essential issues and to call the attention of the readers concerning political leaders who can use their position to abuse the power and betray their previous speech of freedom and equality.   Firstly, it is vital to mention the intentions of the author when he wrote the novel, then make a parallel with situations which still happen nowadays. The main aim of Animal Farm was to portray the Russian Revolution which used an extremely oppressive and totalitarian government maskerated by socialism. This government, leadered by Stalin, could not fight against the enormous difference between poor's and riches and the exploitation of ordinary people. All these elements can definitely be seen in the novel and deeply analysed, on the grounds that some people have more rights than others. In Animal Farm, Napoleon (a boar) leads a rebelion against the owner of the farm and then begins to control everything and everyone in a tyranic way.

The concept of democracy has constantly been neglected by the ostentation of the political leaders. Since today it is hard to find a community which has not been corrupted. Normally, a person before having the power over a community has idyllics perspectives and democratic views, or at least tries to convince his/her followers, however when this person finally has the chance to concrete his/her plans, all the principles are ignored.

"BRFF1067.txt"," <ICLE-BR-FF-0067.1>  Animal Farm by George Orwell is a fable satirizing the Russian revolution in particular and, more generally the cynism of all revolutions that loudly proclaim equality and justice for all but which end up exploiting the masses and suppressing freedom. This book was published in 1945 where Orwell wrote that All men are equal. But some are more equal than others. Unfortunately, this affirmative has not change through the years.   It is usual to hear that all men are equal and have the same rights. This is all right in theory, but in practice is totally different. The level of social inequalities is not a recent problem; however, this has being considerably increasing nowadays. One of the major cause of this discrepancy is the globalization. In addition to this, we faced the ambicious, greed and the dispute for power and money, as a result, fewer people has the control of the world whereas the majority of the world population is miserable.  The current political system, capitalism, encourages the individualism; consequently, people becomes more selfish and the collective society has been gradually disappearing from human minds. Since childhood, kids are preparing to face this system rules which motivates a cruel competition in order to know who is more qualified to achieve a successful professional life. This fact also contributes to estimulate people to become so self-centered that they will be able to do everything to achieve their goals even not respect the other.  Capitalism is definetly not a egualitarian govern of system because this do not offer tha same opportunities concerning: education, wealthy, food and work for everybody. Only the riches have the chance to obtain these guarantees because they are able to pay for these services which is the right for anyone. Actually, the neo-liberalism encourages the state to invest the populations money accordingly to FMI interests; comsenquently, the state do not give support for its people needs. Therefore, the social inequalities, class hypocrisies and the exploitation of the working class has grown than ever before.  Globalization has been defined in a number of ways, including as a set of processes changing the nature of human interaction across a wide range of spheres including the economic, political, social, technological and environmental. It is clear that all these changes is not efficient to avoid the social inequalities, it is just the opposite. All these transformations accentuates the poveltry around the world where the riches countries dominates and exploits the underdevelopments ones. In other words, the wealth of the world is concentrated on the small part of the globe and just fewer has the control of it whereas this fortune shoul be divided equaly through the world in an attempt to minimize the social inequalities and brings a decent quality of life for all peoples.  In brief, the field of social inequalities continues its vigorous growth in the early years of the 21st century and the concepts of Animal farm is still update and universalized. The minority is still take advantages of the majority and the egualitarian society is seen as an utopia, a dream which can be considered impossible to become concrete. The world situations is about to enter in a colapse because of the gravity of the social problem, the masses can not support all this injustice anymore and it is necessary to review all this system ideologie in order to organize a equalitarian society where, at least, the basics rights shou'd be conserved for all nations.

"BRFF1068.txt"," <ICLE-BR-FF-0068.1>  The society we live in establish patterns which well-succeed people should follow, otherwise they seem impossible to reach. People have to work, to study, to go to the supermarket, to pay the bills and at the same time, they have to be the most efficacious professional, the kindest parents, the most regardful spouse and so on. Moreover, all these stuff has to be often changed, updated and renewed. For women, these obligations can be a little more stressful. In the past, women could fulfill all professional requirements when they got to the market. In some cases, as they were considered inferior, these new workers had to be better than the average. Unfortunately, prejudice brought this behavior to current days. Nowadays, .many women have shown a unbelievable efficiency in order to keep their posts, especially the chief posts. Moreover the conquer of the right of having a carrier did not liberated women from the housewifery duties. These unrewarded job can be as tiring as their profession or even more than it. As a soften policy to ease up all these pressure, the Brazilian government allows women retire five years before man.   Despite of all these efforts, another question comes up: the woman's role in kids education. Many kids are brought up currently without constant presence of their parents. Absence in fathers case is acceptable because most of the fathers role is to provide family. However there is a belief in which the absence of the mother could be harmful for children. Mothers absence should not be connected to lack of affection. Carrier does not overcome mothers role therefore, it does not destroy the link between mother and child. Even because only the quality of the free time both spend together can measure the strength of this link. In many cases, this is a really hard chore, because lots of women have to provide their kids by themselves. In fact, what is really harmful for kids is lack of attention from mother and from father due to their unsubstitutable role in growth and education.  Beliefs like these are part of a great range of concepts which comes in and goes out throughout minds that constitute our society. Sexism is a kind of prejudice which is neither too weak to be ignored nor too strong to complaint about it. Prejudice does not favor women or men, both just have to deal with the limitations it puts in their lives. Thus, female behavior and beauty patterns, that are practically impossible to follow, are everywhere. Maybe, nobody can get rid of the judgements that can be made based on them. They can make a woman lose her job, her marriage and sometimes, her health if she did not fit in the exigencies of these patterns, which demands on extreme beauty and eternal youth. Thus far, to things can happen: some women just get depressed while others submit themselves to plastic surgeries, treatments, diets that not rarely put their health in danger. Everything in order to follow an unwise pattern of beauty and behavior.  Probably, women obey these patterns lead by the education they received before, which sometimes sustain focus on obeying and submission. Young girls growth is plot in a imaginary world in does not incentive the development of decisions or the ways to solve problems. They are just made to believe the charming prince will come and save the princess then all problems are solved. At the same time, boys are brought up with different point of views, such as make decisions and take the control of the situation. Notwithstanding the fact that nowadays, kids are having more wise kinds of education a lot of concepts about education related to boys and girls should be revised.  An individual item that really deserves to be revised are the laws related to abortion in Brazil. Illegal and bad-succeed abortion is related to the main cause of dying of poor women in the northern state of Bahia. In So Paulo it takes the third place. The Brazilian health system and laws gives a woman all the support if she wants to get pregnant and have this baby. However, if she does not want have this baby due to a great range of reasons, her rights just end up left in the lurch. Then, she might apply herself to become part of the figures shown before.  The presented until this point just try to elicit that if female conquers have started to do harm, some of them ought to be revised, renewed or updated. And It also must to be realized that lots of these conquers are not enough anymore. ","The society we live in establish patterns which well-succeed people should follow, otherwise they seem impossible to reach. People have to work, to study, to go to the supermarket, to pay the bills and at the same time, they have to be the most efficacious professional, the kindest parents, the most regardful spouse and so on. Moreover, all these stuff has to be often changed, updated and renewed. For women, these obligations can be a little more stressful. In the past, women could fulfill all professional requirements when they got to the market. In some cases, as they were considered inferior, these new workers had to be better than the average. Unfortunately, prejudice brought this behavior to current days. Nowadays, .many women have shown a unbelievable efficiency in order to keep their posts, especially the chief posts. Moreover the conquer of the right of having a carrier did not liberated women from the housewifery duties. These unrewarded job can be as tiring as their profession or even more than it. As a soften policy to ease up all these pressure, the Brazilian government allows women retire five years before man. Despite of all these efforts, another question comes up: the woman's role in kids education. Many kids are brought up currently without constant presence of their parents. Absence in fathers case is acceptable because most of the fathers role is to provide family. However there is a belief in which the absence of the mother could be harmful for children. Mothers absence should not be connected to lack of affection. Carrier does not overcome mothers role therefore, it does not destroy the link between mother and child. Even because only the quality of the free time both spend together can measure the strength of this link. In many cases, this is a really hard chore, because lots of women have to provide their kids by themselves. In fact, what is really harmful for kids is lack of attention from mother and from father due to their unsubstitutable role in growth and education. Beliefs like these are part of a great range of concepts which comes in and goes out throughout minds that constitute our society. Sexism is a kind of prejudice which is neither too weak to be ignored nor too strong to complaint about it. Prejudice does not favor women or men, both just have to deal with the limitations it puts in their lives. Thus, female behavior and beauty patterns, that are practically impossible to follow, are everywhere. Maybe, nobody can get rid of the judgements that can be made based on them. They can make a woman lose her job, her marriage and sometimes, her health if she did not fit in the exigencies of these patterns, which demands on extreme beauty and eternal youth. Thus far, to things can happen: some women just get depressed while others submit themselves to plastic surgeries, treatments, diets that not rarely put their health in danger. Everything in order to follow an unwise pattern of beauty and behavior. Probably, women obey these patterns lead by the education they received before, which sometimes sustain focus on obeying and submission. Young girls growth is plot in a imaginary world in does not incentive the development of decisions or the ways to solve problems. They are just made to believe the charming prince will come and save the princess then all problems are solved. At the same time, boys are brought up with different point of views, such as make decisions and take the control of the situation. Notwithstanding the fact that nowadays, kids are having more wise kinds of education a lot of concepts about education related to boys and girls should be revised. An individual item that really deserves to be revised are the laws related to abortion in Brazil. Illegal and bad-succeed abortion is related to the main cause of dying of poor women in the northern state of Bahia. In So Paulo it takes the third place. The Brazilian health system and laws gives a woman all the support if she wants to get pregnant and have this baby. However, if she does not want have this baby due to a great range of reasons, her rights just end up left in the lurch. Then, she might apply herself to become part of the figures shown before. The presented until this point just try to elicit that if female conquers have started to do harm, some of them ought to be revised, renewed or updated. And It also must to be realized that lots of these conquers are not enough anymore."

"BRFF1070.txt"," <ICLE-BR-FF-0070.1>  Women surely had been abused and insulted throughout the years. However, the feminist movements were not the best tools to change this reality. The figure of women have been overexposed and misunderstood because of them. At home or inside the society, women have been discovering a different stereotype.   Throughout the years, the fragile sex have been abused by a masculine society. Men's point of view had been targeted as the right one. Women could not vote, or even speak in public in several societies. The only role that had to be played by women was taking care of children and home. They were made to be wives (housewives). They were treated as animals, but not human beings sometimes.  Within the time, the feminist movements had raised to be women's exit from the exile. They seemed to claim for better, even equal, rights. Do they really exist? May it be possible someday? The answer tends to be negative. Men and women are different individuals. They will at any time have different roles to play in the society.  However, it does not mean they have to be under men's position, or abused or even insulted. Even having different purposes, each sex has its own collaboration to mankind. Men really are physically stronger than women. So are the women, but mentally. Men could not take care of babies, for example, better than women. Women could not carry supermarket bags as easily as men.  On the other hand, a woman can be the president of a company or country. Yet, men are the ones to be respected as the responsible for taking care of family rights and integrity.  Principally in Brazil, the feminist movements have been causing harm to the women's figure. It is possible to see many girls boozing or kissing more than one man per night. This essay does not claim that men can have those harmful attitudes, but it chooses to show that women is acting like men, principally in the black side, because of the wrong fight for equal rights. Their bodies are common place, their beauty are not to be respected any longer. Their opinion is still denied, because their bodies replace it, regardless of any right!  Equal rights do not mean equal attitudes. Women can perform men's actions with feminine attitudes and approaches. But doing the same, is a regress. The feminist movements are to modernize or to make society, not only women, proceed. ","Women surely had been abused and insulted throughout the years.

"BRFF1071.txt"," <ICLE-BR-FF-0071.1>  In Brazil, as well as in most Western countries, the penitentiary system consists of arresting criminals, judging them and throwing them in prison for several years, as a means of punishment. In order to keep the society safe and free from criminals, they are kept in prison, where they should learn the value of life, respect and other important aspects to consider when living in a community.   However, it is known that the penitentiary system is flawed. In Brazil, there are several corrupt policemen, who are bribed by drug dealers to shut their eyes to the dealers illegal negotiations. Thus, a number of the most dangerous criminals are free on the streets, while a poor man who stole a box of milk at the supermarket is in prison. In addition, influent, famous and rich people hardly ever get arrested, and when they do, they manage to get an habeas corpus as soon as possible, whether through a very good lawyer or blackmailing important people. For example, Michael Jackson was accused of sexually harassing several children and, in spite of the evidences presented in the trial, he was considered not guilty. Another good example is the Brazilian actor Marcelo Antony, who was found with a considerable quantity of drugs in his possession, but did not go to trial.  Another important aspect to be considered is that most jails in Brazil are crowded, which causes fights, murders, rapes and desire for revenge in the convicts. Moreover, they are mistreated, beaten up by the policemen, badly fed and humiliated. Their anger grows to a point from which there is no return. If they are ever released, they will kill a large number of people, because they lost any trace of conscience that they could have had, as portrayed in the movie Sleepers.  Therefore, the prison system is outdated. Less dangerous criminals, like thieves, drug users or hackers, when arrested, should be rehabilitated, that is, they should do work to help the community. Thus, they would be free from the dangerous environment of the jails, working and living in places where they would feel punished since they would have an obligation to be there, but at the same time learning to live with ordinary people and like them, without drugs or thefts.  On the other hand, murderers and convicts of rape do not change their minds doing community work or being given another chance. They do not feel guilty about what they do, and if they are released, they will keep committing their crimes. Since there is no rehabilitation possible for them and they are not sick, but evil, they should be killed. They are very dangerous people, who can escape from prison easily, and our society cannot afford to have these kind of criminals on the loose.  Taking into consideration all the mentioned above, it can be concluded that the penitentiary system is outdated and could be improved by establishing the death penalty for the most dangerous criminals and creating rehabilitation centers and techniques for the less dangerous convicts.
